                    Sushi is one of the first foods that spring to mind when we think about Japanese cuisine. This
                    delicacy was one of the first Japanese dishes to be exported to the US after the Meiji Restoration
                    in 1868, and since then its popularity has steadily increased year after year.

                    The word ‘sushi’ refers to any dish made with Japanese rice that has been seasoned with rice
                    vinegar. Common varieties of sushi include makizushi (sushi rice and fillings rolled up in nori
                    seaweed), nigiri sushi (shaped, bite-size mounds of sushi rice with single slices of raw fish or
                    similar draped over the top) and inarizushi (sushi rice stuffed inside pockets of inari; a type of
                    seasoned, fried tofu).

                    One of the three main noodle varieties eaten in Japan; udon noodles are thick, chewy, and
                    traditionally
                    made from wheat flour and brine water.
                    Udon can be served in a number of different ways (mixed into stir fries, added to hot pots, served
                    cold
                    with a tsuyu or tentsuyu soup base on the side for dipping), but are most commonly used in noodle
                    soups,
                    where they are served in a savoury soup broth with different garnishes.
                    Some of the most common udon noodle soup dishes include kitsune udon (‘fox udon’, topped with
                    aburaage
                    fried tofu), tempura udon (topped with tempura battered seafood and vegetables), and chikara udon
                    (‘power udon’, topped with grilled mochi rice cakes).

                    Although tofu is mainly thought of in Western countries as a health food or vegetarian alternative,
                    in
                    Southeast Asian countries like Japan, tofu (particularly silken tofu) is enjoyed by everybody and is
                    a
                    common part of the traditional diet.

                    To answer the question ‘what is tofu?’, it is soy milk that has been coagulated, with the resulting
                    curds
                    being pressed into blocks. These blocks come in differing levels of firmness, and can be eaten
                    uncooked
                    (perhaps with a couple of savoury garnishes), boiled in hot pots, or fried into tasty pieces of
                    aburaage and
                    used as a garnish.
